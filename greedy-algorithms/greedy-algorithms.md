# Greedy Algorithms

Solves a problem with this principle: at each step, pick the ***locally optimum*** solution, and in the end you will arrive at the globally optimum solution.
It doesn't always get the optimal solution, but it will get close.
There are sometimes that you don't need to get the perfect solution, and this algorithm works.
