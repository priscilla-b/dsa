# Greedy Algorithms

Solves a problem with this principle: at each step, pick the ***locally optimum*** solution, and in the end you will arrive at the globally optimum solution.
It doesn't always get the optimal solution, but it will get close.

There are situations where you don't need to get the perfect solution, and that's when algorithm works.

Greedy algorithms are ***approximation algorithms*** and are judged by:
- how fast they are and 
- how close they are to the optimal solution

** Dijkstra is a greedy algorithm
